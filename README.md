## Getting Started:

- Get your API keys: Your API requests are authenticated using API keys. You can [get your free API key by signing up for an NFTPort account](https://dashboard.nftport.xyz/sign-up).

- Download Unity 2020.3.18f [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.18) <br/>
  >*SDK is made using Unity 2020.3.18f , however is compatible with other versions as well. We'll be working towards Unity Asset Store release to make process easier.*

- Download the NFTPort extension:
  - Option 1: clone this Github repository and open the [Unity project](./NFT_UnitySDK).
  - Option 2: download the Unity package and import in your project
  - Option 3: copy the [NFT_UnitySDK Folder](./NFT_UnitySDK/Assets/NFTPort%20SDK) in your project Assets directory.

<br/>

## First steps inside Unity:
- Setup your NFTPort API Key in Window / NFTPort <br/>

*The best way to learn is by doing! We've provided a basic demo scene for play in `demo.cs`.

<br/>


## Quickstart via `NFTPort_Interface.cs`:

Add NFTPort_Interface.cs in your scene.<br/>

<img src="./Readme-Assets/port_interface.jpg"  width="300"  />  <br/>
> `NFTPort_Interface` provides a globally accessible class which routes into individual components. You can only have one of this in your scene, other instances will get deleted at runtime. Adding `NFTPort_Interface.cs` will automatically add other required components. <br/>

In your script, include NFTPort:

```csharp
using NFTPort;
```

### Usage

Getting All Addresses Of an NFT:
```csharp
NFTPort_Interface.Instance.NFTsOfAccount(addressString);
```

Getting All NFT's of a Contract:
```csharp
NFTPort_Interface.Instance.NFTsFromContract(ContractString);
```

Easy Mint NFT via URL:
```csharp
NFTPort_Interface.Instance.Mint(FileUrlString, AddressString, NFTMintNameString);
```


If you do not need to change chain ID at runtime, you can get most done by above and set the chain ID and include parameters in the inspector on individual components.

When you call general functions above using NFTPort_Interface.cs, the data gets sorted according to each NFT and populated in model of the following individual components below it, as seen in Unity Inpector Window. Any further actions utilising this data can be refrenced from these scripts. You can also link events from these individual components (view editor window of components(on object NFTPort) in demo scene and demo.cs) <br/>

```csharp
NFTsOwnedbyanAccount._ownedbyAddressModel.nfts[i].name;
```



<br/>


## Individual Components:
###### Use Fetched Data : Modify chains, ID , Settings and more:

### NFTs_ownedbyanAccount.cs
>Component provides All NFT's owned by the account.  <br/>
<img src="./Readme-Assets/ownedbyAccount.jpg"  width="500"  /> <br/>


#### Setting up Variables and Run()<br/>
These can be setup directly through inspector.
For Runtime or setting up through script following can be used by refrencing the component, in this example as : _NFTsOwnedbyanAccount .
```
_NFTsOwnedbyanAccount.Address = "0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B";
_NFTsOwnedbyanAccount.chain = "ethereum";
_NFTsOwnedbyanAccount.include = "all";
```

```
_NFTsOwnedbyanAccount.Run();
```
<br/>
Any events after a successful fetch can be done via:
<img src="./Readme-Assets/eventsafter.jpg"  width="400"  />

##### Other Individual components can be used in similar fashion.
